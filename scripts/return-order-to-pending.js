/**
 * Put an order back to Pending, with nothing paid against it.
 *
 * ── Why this is a script and not an endpoint ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no legal transition back to Pending. TRANSITIONS in
 * orderStatus.service.js reads Pending -> Paid -> Released -> Loading ->
 * Completed and never the other way, deliberately: once a truck has gated in,
 * the order describes something that physically happened. So this writes
 * `orders.status` directly, which is exactly the kind of thing that should
 * take a named script, a dry run and a rollback file rather than a button.
 *
 * ── What it does ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. Refuses outright if any payment row still stands on the order. Resetting
 *      amount_paid to 0 while rows remain would put the cached figure BELOW its
 *      own evidence — the mirror of the ₦1.11bn overstatement migration 0021
 *      left behind. Unmatch the payments first (the dashboard can do this now;
 *      see the paymentParam fix), then run this.
 *
 *   2. Deletes the order's tickets. A ticket is authority to load, and
 *      `ticket_status` has no void state — Active or Redeemed, nothing else —
 *      so a ticket issued for a payment that has since been removed cannot be
 *      neutralised in place. Leaving it would let the full quantity be loaded
 *      against an unpaid, pending order. Confirming payment again regenerates
 *      it: runPostPaymentEffects is idempotent.
 *
 *   3. Deletes the order's commission rows, for the same reason — they were
 *      written by the post-payment effects of a payment that no longer exists.
 *
 *   4. Sets status Pending, paymentStatus Unpaid, amountPaid 0,
 *      paymentConfirmedAt null, and writes an audit row naming what it removed.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT touch: the PFI allocation. The order is still
 * live and still holds its quantity against the batch. And order_trucks — if a
 * truck has gated out, product physically left the depot, and deleting that
 * record would erase the only evidence of it. The script warns instead.
 *
 * ── Read this before running it on a delivered order ──────────────────────
 *
 * `findStalePending` sweeps orders that are Pending AND Unpaid AND older than
 * ORDER_EXPIRY_HOURS, expires them, and hands their reserved stock back to the
 * PFI. That is correct for an order nobody has loaded. It is NOT correct for
 * one whose trucks have gated out: the stock is physically gone, and returning
 * it to the batch invents inventory. The script refuses those unless you pass
 * --gated-out-anyway, so the decision is explicit.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/return-order-to-pending.js --order=11761           # dry run
 *   node scripts/return-order-to-pending.js --order=11761 --apply
 *   node scripts/return-order-to-pending.js --order=11761 --apply --gated-out-anyway
 *
 * --apply writes scripts/rollback-order-to-pending-<stamp>.json holding the
 * order's previous status and money columns plus every ticket and commission
 * row removed, so the change can be undone.
