 *     left the bank, so the figures are a record of what happened rather than
 *     a proposal, and an ordinary edit would silently restate a settled
 *     payment. But records do need correcting — a wrong TIN, an invoice figure
 *     keyed a digit out, an expense booked to the wrong cargo — and the
 *     alternative to allowing it is someone editing the database by hand,
 *     which leaves no trail at all. So one role can, every change is diffed
 *     into the audit trail with `edited_by`, and everything the figure feeds
 *     recomputes from it (nothing downstream is stored — see lib/pfiFinance).
 *   · Otherwise anyone on the request may edit it: the officer who raised it
 *     and every role that has to sign it off. A reviewer who spots a wrong
 *     TIN should fix it rather than bounce the request back a stage and wait.
 *
 * Returns `{ ok }` or `{ ok: false, status, message }` so the caller can send
 * the right HTTP code and the exact reason. `postPayment` comes back true when
 * the edit is a super admin correcting a settled row, so the caller can mark
 * the audit entry as the amendment it is rather than an ordinary edit.
 *
 * The PATCH route had no check of its own at all before this: any
 * authenticated member of staff could rewrite any expense at any stage,
 * including a paid one.
