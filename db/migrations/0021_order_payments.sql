-- Order-first payments: money is received against an ORDER, matched to a bank
-- statement line, and never against a customer's wallet.
--
-- Written by hand in the style of 0002–0020, for the reason set out in 0003:
-- drizzle-kit has no snapshot of this database. Every statement is idempotent,
-- so re-running the file is a no-op.
--
-- ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Until now the money path was: bank statement line → a `deposits` credit on
-- the CUSTOMER's wallet → `customers.balance` → a `wallet_holds` row debiting
-- that balance for an order. Which deposit paid which order was not recorded
-- by any of that. It was reconstructed afterwards into
-- `order_deposit_allocations` by walking the wallet oldest-credit-first, and
-- where even that was missing the finance report walked it newest-first at
-- read time and printed the guess in the same columns as real bank data.
--
-- Three things followed, all of them found in the live data:
--
--   * An order confirmed against one specific ₦18m bank credit was written up
--     as slices of three unrelated ones, because the wallet, not the order,
--     was the thing being debited.
--   * 101 orders read as overpaid by ₦1.19bn in total and 41 read short,
--     against payments that had in fact been made correctly.
--   * The two ledgers disagree outright: `balance = credits − debits − holds`
--     fails for 254 customers, by ₦213.6bn.
--
-- None of that is auditable against a bank statement, which is the only thing
-- an external auditor will accept.
--
-- After this migration there is ONE record of money received against an order,
-- `order_payments`, and each row carries the bank statement line's own
-- details — value date, depositor, narration, bank reference, the account it
-- was paid into — copied onto it at match time. The report prints that row.
-- It does not reconstruct anything.
--
-- Surplus stays on the order that received it. Moving it to another order is
-- an explicit, recorded act (`order_payment_transfers`) rather than a wallet
-- debit with the destination typed into a free-text description, which is how
-- it was done before and which the report recovered with a regex.
--
-- The wallet tables (`deposits`, `wallet_holds`, `order_deposit_allocations`)
-- are deliberately NOT dropped here. They hold the history this backfill is
-- derived from, and ₦31.7m of live customer credit still to be reconciled
-- onto orders. They stop being written for order payments; they stay readable.

-- ── 1. Explicit order → order movement of surplus ──────────────────────────
--
-- Created before order_payments because that table carries an FK to this one.
--
-- The two legs of a transfer are ordinary order_payments rows (a negative one
-- on the order it leaves, a positive one on the order it lands on), both
-- pointing here. So the report needs no special case: it sums the payment
-- rows on an order, and an order that has given its surplus away nets down to
-- what it actually kept.

-- That is the whole point of the table. The previous report resolved them by
-- joining back through `deposits` to whichever line had the lowest id, which

-- effectively arbitrary date under a column headed "Deposit Date". A snapshot

-- ── 3. Backfill: the statement-backed payments ─────────────────────────────
--
-- Every allocation whose deposit came off a bank statement line becomes an
-- order_payments row carrying that line's own details.
--
-- One order per line, and which order is not a guess: `source = 'bank'` was
-- written at confirm time and means "this line was claimed FOR this order".
-- Where nothing says so (a handful of legacy rows), the order that consumed
-- the most of it wins, with the lowest order id breaking a tie — the same
-- ordering the old report used for its `primaryOrderId`, kept only because
-- for those rows nothing better was ever written down.
--
-- `amount` is the line at FACE value, not the slice the order consumed. That
-- is the figure on the bank statement, and reconciling against the statement
-- one line at a time is the entire purpose of this table. Where the line
-- overshot the order, the surplus shows on the order as a surplus — which is
-- what it is — and section 4 turns any onward movement of it into a transfer.

-- — the report showed ₦100m against one and ₦54.45m against the other, and
-- the ₦54.45m was counted twice.
--
-- It is one payment and one movement, and that is how it is recorded now: the
-- line lands whole on 11448 (section 3), and the draw becomes a transfer of
-- ₦54,450,000 from 11448 to 11489, with a leg on each order.
