/**
 * Which roles may reach which API resource.
 *
 * Role-based gating is off dashboard-wide: any signed-in staff member may
 * read and write every listed resource, regardless of role. Location/PFI
 * scope (see lib/scopeFilter.js) still narrows *which rows* a non-super_admin
 * sees or can act on — that check is independent of this file and stays
 * fully in force. This file only ever decided whether the endpoint was
 * reachable at all, and now it says yes to everyone who's logged in.
 *
 * An unlisted mount is still closed by default (see checkApiAccess) — that's
 * not a role restriction, it's a new-route safety net so an endpoint has to
 * be added here deliberately rather than opening by omission.
 *
 * super_admin is implicit everywhere and never listed.

   * live session (see authenticateStaff). This removes authorisation between
   * signed-in staff; it does not remove the lock on the door.
