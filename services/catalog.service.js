 * The short trade code a product is known by on the floor — PMS, AGO, LPG.
 *
 * This used to be read straight off `products.category`, because that column
 * literally held "PMS (Premium Motor Spirit)". Normalising categories on
 * 2026-08-09 replaced those with real classifications, so every catalog client
 * started showing "Fuel" where it had shown "PMS": the mobile app rendered a
 * product called Petrol with a badge reading Fuel, while order history — which
 * reads name and sku separately — still said Petrol. Same product, two answers,
 * depending on the screen.
 *
 * `sku` is where the trade code actually lives, so that is what this reads.
 * The hyphen is stripped because clients key their product metadata on JETA1,
 * not JET-A1, and `initials(name)` is the last resort for a product whose sku
 * was never filled in — "Cooking Gas" is a better badge than an empty one.

 * The single definition of "orderable" — shared by every sales channel.

 * The WhatsApp engine and the portal must never disagree about what can be
 * bought where and at what price, so both load through here.
 *
 * The rule is a PRICE, and only a price: a depot sells a product when someone
 * has set a figure above zero against it. Stock used to gate this too — a
 * depot with no active PFI was filtered out entirely — which meant a depot
 * created and priced in the admin stayed invisible on the site, in the
 * snapshot and in the order flow, with nothing on screen to say why. Stock is
 * still measured and still reserved when it exists (see placeOrder), it just
 * no longer decides what may be advertised or bought.
