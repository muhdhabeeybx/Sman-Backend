 * `depot_id` are real foreign keys, so grouping by depot is exact. Only
 * `daily_reports.location` is free text (staff type it on the form), so a
 * report row is matched to a depot by substring — the depot name appears
 * inside what staff typed ("Port Harcourt — Avidor Depot" contains "Avidor
 * Depot") — with any report whose location matches no depot kept under its
 * own literal text rather than silently dropped.
 *
 * Which depots appear: any depot with an active PFI, unioned with any depot a
 * daily report matched to for this date — mirroring the Django rule ("PFIs
 * with status=active, unioned with any location that has a staff entry").

 * "KEONAMEX PET WARRI" are all one place in Warri North.

 * while 62 sheets filed as "Soroman Warri — Keonamex Depot" sat outside the
 * depot they belong to.
 *
 * Matching is on DISTINCTIVE words instead: a word appearing in exactly one
 * depot's name identifies that depot ("keonamex", "avidor", "tsl", "calabar"),
 * and a word appearing in several ("port", "harcourt", "depot", "soroman")
 * identifies nothing and is ignored. That is what makes this safe — "Port
 * Harcourt — Liquid Bulk" and "Port Harcourt — Avidor Depot" share both their
 * first two words and are still told apart correctly.
