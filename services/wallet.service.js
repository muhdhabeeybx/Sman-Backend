 * reversal, so the balance guard had money to work against — and the whole
 * thing existed only because a MATCHED line could never otherwise be released.
 *
 * The replacement is two plain operations, neither of which touches a balance:
 * remove the wrong payment from the order (its statement line goes back to the
 * unmatched pool) and record the right one. See
 * services/orderPayment.service.js — removePayment() and

 * what stopped anything from recording which bank row paid for which order.
