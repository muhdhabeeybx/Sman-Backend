 * may cut tickets for 50,000 litres, not the whole order. Pay the rest later
 * and the remainder unlocks. Quantity is the unit trucks are loaded in, so the
 * money figure has to be converted back through the order's own unit price.
 *
 * Two rounding decisions, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - Floored to 2dp, never rounded up. order_trucks.quantity is decimal(15,2),
 *     so 2dp is the finest a load can actually be written at, and rounding up
 *     would authorise litres nobody has paid for. A part payment of ₦12,000,000
 *     at ₦241/litre buys 49,792.53 litres, not 49,792.54.
 *
 *   - A fully-paid order returns its quantity EXACTLY, rather than the division.
 *     total_amount is stored, not recomputed, so on an order whose total was
 *     rounded at creation the division can land a hair under the quantity —
 *     which would leave the last few litres of a fully-paid order permanently
 *     unticketable. Nobody would ever find that by reading the number; they
 *     would just find a truck they could not load.

 *   now      the payment IS the statement line, recorded against this order.
 *            Nothing can confirm an order except naming the bank rows that
 *            paid for it, and no balance is drawn on to cover a shortfall.
 *
 * Instalments need no special handling. Each call records whatever lines are
 * given, `recomputeOrder` re-derives the order's money columns from every
 * payment row it now has, and the order lands on Part Paid or Paid by
 * arithmetic. Only the FIRST payment moves the order's status — it is what
 * opens the pipeline, because a part-paid order still has to reach the
 * ticketing desk to be any use; a later instalment finds it already Released
 * and only the money columns change.
 *
 * A line larger than what the order owes is NOT trimmed to fit. The surplus
 * lands on the order and shows there, and moving it somewhere useful is an
 * explicit transfer (see orderPayment.service.transferSurplus). That is the
 * whole point: money stays attached to the order it was paid against until
