/**
 * Sending the daily reports — the one path, used by both callers.
 *
 * There are two triggers: `scripts/send-daily-report.js`, run by hand, and the
 * pg-boss cron in jobs/scheduler.js that fires at 23:50 Africa/Lagos. They must
 * do the same thing. Kept as two implementations they would drift, which is how
 * the SMS copy ended up with the same message written two different ways; the
 * script is now a thin CLI over this module.
 *
 * What "without failure" actually requires, and where each part lives:
 *
 *   the job runs at all      pg-boss cron, DB-coordinated so it fires once even
 *                            across several Railway instances (jobs/scheduler)
 *   transient faults retry   pg-boss retryLimit/retryBackoff (config/queue)
 *   it cannot send twice     the idempotency check below, keyed on the report
 *                            date, because a retry after a PARTIAL success
 *                            would otherwise re-send to everyone
 *   failure is noticed       dispatchDailyReports throws, the queue dead-letters,
 *                            and jobs/scheduler raises staff.report_send_failed
 *
 * The piece people forget is the third: a retry is only safe if the work is
 * idempotent, and "send an email" is not.
