 * ── What this replaced ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A "Total revenue" that silently summed three different books: order revenue,
 * offline sales, and payments on the delivery (truck sales) ledger. For August
 * that headline read ₦77.68bn while the only component shown beneath it read
 * ₦73.78bn — the ₦3.90bn difference was delivery payments, whose row was
 * commented out. A headline and its own breakdown differing by ₦3.9bn with
 * nothing on the page accounting for it is the single most likely reason
 * somebody says the financial summary is not correct.
 *
 * Two further problems in the same figure:
 *
 *   * it counted orders with payment_status = 'Paid' only, so a part-paid
 *     order contributed nothing at all; and
 *   * it summed total_amount — what was BILLED — and called it revenue, which
 *     is what was invoiced, not what came in.
 *
 * Now: billed and received are two named figures from order_payments, the same
 * table the finance report reconciles against the bank statement, so the
 * dashboard and the finance report cannot disagree. Delivery-ledger payments
 * are returned separately and labelled, never folded into an order figure.
