/**
 * How much work is waiting, per desk.
 *
 * One query set feeding two things: the number badges in the sidebar, and the
 * "what is waiting on me" landing page. They are the same question asked twice,
 * so they are answered once — a badge that disagrees with the page it links to
 * is worse than no badge.
 *
 * Every queue is keyed by the NAV PATH it belongs to. The sidebar is then a
 * dumb lookup (`counts[item.path]`) and adding a queue is a change in one
 * place rather than a change here plus a mapping table over there.
 *
 * ── Scoped to the person, and not a permission gate ────────────────────────
 *
 * A badge answers "how much is waiting on ME". Somebody who runs Calabar
 * wants Calabar's two pending tickets, not the company's two thousand — a
 * number they cannot act on is a number they learn to ignore, and once they
 * ignore it the badge is worse than absent.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT go through lib/scopeFilter. That helper is the
 * authorisation gate, and it was switched off at the owner's instruction in
 * 76d3e95 — every signed-in member of staff may do everything, and that
 * stands. Nothing here stops anyone opening any page or acting on any row.
 * It narrows what gets COUNTED for them, which is a view preference.
 *
 * A user with no depots and no PFIs assigned is not narrowed to nothing: they
 * see the company's queues. Failing closed here would hand somebody an empty
 * dashboard and no clue why, which is the exact defect 76d3e95 records.

/**
 * Build a WHERE from conditions, dropping the empty ones.
 *
 * `scopeCondition` returns NULL for a full-access user, and Drizzle's `and()`
 * strips `undefined` but NOT `null` — a null is bound as a parameter, so
 * `and(a, b, null)` compiles to `a AND b AND $3` with $3 = NULL, and the whole
 * predicate evaluates to NULL. Every count silently came back 0.
