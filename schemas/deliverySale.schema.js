 * AUDIT H4 — this controller called `deliverySaleRepo.create(req.body)` and
 * `update(id, req.body)` with the raw body. Three columns made that dangerous,
 * and all three are deliberately absent from these schemas:
 *
 *   paystackReference  pre-claiming a reference poisons webhook idempotency,
 *                      so a real incoming payment is later dropped as a
 *                      duplicate and the money is never credited
 *   paystackDetails    attacker-authored payment metadata
 *   depositStatus      forge a fully-paid sale outright
 *
 * They are written by the payment pipeline, never by a request. Because zod
 * strips unknown keys, sending them now removes them rather than ignoring them.
