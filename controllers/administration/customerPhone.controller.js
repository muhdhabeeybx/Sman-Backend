 * changes SIM and keeps both. Until now each of those was a separate customer
 * row, so only one of them could reach the wallet and the order history the
 * business actually holds for that person. These endpoints are how the desk
 * records the rest, and every number recorded here signs in to the same
 * account (customerRepo.findByAnyPhone).
 *
 * See db/migrations/0019_customer_phone_numbers.sql for why the primary stays

/**
 * POST /api/customers/:id/phones — add a number to the account.
 *
 * Three refusals, in the order that gives the clearest answer:
 *
 *   1. Not a phone number at all. Rejected outright — an unparseable number is
 *      not a contact detail, it is a typo, and 115 of the 1,380 numbers on the
 *      live book are exactly this.
 *   2. Already held by somebody else. Named, not just refused: "that number is
 *      taken" leaves the desk unable to tell a duplicate of their own customer
 *      from a genuine clash, and the owner's name settles it in one line.
 *   3. Already on this account. Answered as a no-op rather than an error —
 *      adding a number twice is a double-click, not a mistake worth a red box.
 *
 * A landline or VOIP line is ALLOWED through, with a warning attached. It is a
 * real way to reach the customer and worth recording; it just cannot carry an
 * SMS, so it can never be a sign-in number and the response says so.
