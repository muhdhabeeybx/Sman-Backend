/**
 * The day in words, before any table.
 *
 * ── Why prose, and why it is generated rather than written by a model ──────
 *
 * The report answers "what were the numbers". It did not answer "how was
 * today", and that is the question the person opening it at midnight actually
 * has. Reading six depot tables to work out that Dangote filed nothing is work
 * a report should have already done.
 *
 * These sentences are composed from the same data the tables are rendered
 * from — deterministically, with no model in the loop. That is deliberate for
 * a document about money: a summary that occasionally invents a figure is
 * worse than no summary, it costs nothing to run, it cannot fail at 23:50, and
 * two people reading the same day always see the same words.
 *
 * ── House style ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One statement per paragraph, not a packed block — the summary is skimmed
 * standing up, and a reader looking for the confirmed figure should find it on
 * its own line rather than three clauses into a paragraph about depots.
 *
 * Plain reporting register: "were received", "recorded the highest sales",
 * "increased by 36% compared with". And "litres" lower-case in prose, though
 * the table columns capitalise it — a sentence is not a column heading.
 *
 * REMARKS are keyed by depot, one line each, in the form
 *
 *     DANGOTE REFINERY: No report was submitted today.
 *
 * because every remark is about a specific site and somebody has to act on it
 * there. A count ("1 depot filed nothing") names nobody to call.
