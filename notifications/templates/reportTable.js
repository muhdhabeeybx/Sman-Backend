 * The report used to be green throughout: green header rows, a green tint on
 * every key cell, green section labels, a green rule above each depot. Colour
 * that is everywhere carries no information — it was decoration, and it made
 * the figures harder to pick out rather than easier.
 *
 * So the document is ink on white, and colour is spent on the two things a
 * reader looks for first: what came IN — revenue and litres sold — in green,
 * and what is LEFT or STILL OWED — closing stock, balances, unpaid commission
 * — in red. Nothing else is coloured, which is what makes those two legible.
