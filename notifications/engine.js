/**
 * The notification engine.
 *
 * One entry point — `notify(type, { to, data })` — serving the mobile app, the
 * admin dashboard and the web portal alike. It decides WHO hears about
 * something (recipients), WHETHER they want to (preferences, quiet hours),
 * HOW they hear (channels) and records WHAT actually happened (deliveries).
 * Copy and routing live in ./catalog.js; business code supplies only facts.
 *
 * Two invariants shape everything below:
 *
 *   1. A notification must never break the business operation that triggered
 *      it. An order that committed has committed; a Termii outage cannot be
 *      allowed to turn that into a 500. Every failure path here therefore
 *      logs and continues.
 *
 *   2. Every attempt is recorded. "The customer says they weren't told" is
 *      answerable from `notification_deliveries` — including the sends that
 *      were deliberately suppressed by someone's own preferences.
