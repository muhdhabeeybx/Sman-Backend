 * not fixed here: see `messageClassFor` below.

/**
 * Which Termii route this notification is entitled to, read off its catalog
 * category.
 *
 * Everything the platform sends is transactional except the marketing
 * category — an order confirmation, a payment receipt, a loading ticket, a
 * security notice and a depot-closure announcement are all things the customer
 * needs and did not choose to receive as advertising. Those go down the `dnd`
 * route first, which is the only one that reaches the roughly one-in-three
 * Nigerian numbers on the Do-Not-Disturb register.
 *
 * `marketing` is the exception and stays on `generic`. A DND registration IS
 * the opt-out from promotional SMS; routing promos around it is what gets a
 * sender ID's DND approval pulled, and the OTPs share that approval. The split
 * is why the admin broadcast carries a category at all — an outage notice sent
 * as `system` reaches a DND-registered customer, an advert sent as `marketing`
 * correctly does not.
 *
 * Anything with no category — a caller that sent a bare type, or an entry
 * still being written — is treated as transactional. Getting a promo onto the
 * cheaper, more restricted route by mistake is a wasted send; getting a
 * payment instruction onto it is a customer who never learns where to pay.
