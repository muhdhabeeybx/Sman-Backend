/**
 * Correcting the money on an order after it has been delivered.
 *
 * Two guards used to make an order's payment record permanent the moment it
 * read as paid, and both fired on real work the desk was trying to do:
 *
 *   * "Order is already paid" — refused on `paymentStatus`, which is derived
 *     from `amount_paid`, a cached figure the 0021 backfill left OVERSTATING
 *     the payment rows on 36 orders by ₦1.11bn in total. VG11105 is carried as
 *     Paid on ₦139,896,000 with only ₦114,570,000 of rows behind it, and this
 *     guard blocked the desk from attaching the lines that would close the gap.
 *
 *   * "Cannot pay an order in Completed status" — money does not stop arriving
 *     when the last truck leaves, and an order whose lines were unmatched after
 *     delivery (they had been matched to the wrong order) could never be given
 *     the right ones.
 *
 * Underneath the second was a third failure, reachable only once the status
 * guard was lifted: an unmatched-after-delivery order has `amount_paid` back at
 * 0, so it looks like a first payment, and the first payment tries to move the
 * status to Paid — which is illegal from Completed and threw
 * "An order cannot move from Completed to Paid".
 *
 * What must NOT change: a cancelled or lapsed order still refuses money.
