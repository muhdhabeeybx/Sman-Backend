/**
 * The second path param on the payment routes has to survive validation.
 *
 * `validate({ params })` replaces req.params with what the schema returns, and
 * Zod strips whatever the schema does not declare — that stripping is the
 * whitelist which closes mass assignment, so it is not going away. Four routes
 * carrying two params were validated against `idParam`, which declares only
 * `id`, so `paymentId` and `transferId` were deleted on the way to the
 * controller.
 *
 * What that looked like from the desk: every attempt to unmatch a payment came
 * back a flat 400. Nothing in the message mentioned an id — the controller read
 * `undefined`, `Number(undefined)` produced NaN, Postgres refused NaN as an
 * integer (SQLSTATE 22P02) and the error handler renders that as "Invalid
 * identifier or value". The correction path for a mis-matched payment was
 * simply unusable, which is why it had to be done by hand against the database.
 *
 * A 404 here is the PASSING result: it means the id arrived intact and the
 * service looked for a payment that genuinely does not exist. A 400 means it
 * was stripped again.
