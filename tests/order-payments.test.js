/**
 * Money received against an ORDER, and nothing else.
 *
 * The property every test here defends: what an order was paid with is what
 * the bank statement says, recorded against that order, and no balance
 * anywhere is ever drawn on to make an order look settled.
 *
 * This replaced order-payment-attribution.test.js, which tested the same
 * intent under the wallet model — including one case ("a shortfall is drawn
 * from wallet balance and marked as such") whose expected behaviour is now
 * exactly the bug. That case is inverted below.
 *
 * Order 11453 in production is what the whole area exists for. Staff matched
 * an ₦18,075,000 credit from TETRIS ENERGY to it; the report showed ₦250,000
 * from a stranger, ₦250,000 from an internal transfer, and ₦9,724,500 of the
 * credit actually chosen. Every figure unfindable on a bank statement, on a
 * report whose only purpose is to agree with one.
